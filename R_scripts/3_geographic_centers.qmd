## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r setup}

```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{r reading in cleaned bio data}
#| echo: false
#| message: false

bio_data_clean <- read_csv(file = "data/clean_data/bio_data.csv")

# head(bio_data_clean)

```


```{r lionfish data subset}

lionfish_data <- bio_data_clean %>% 
  filter(GENUS_BGS == "PTEROIS")

## need to add zeroes to the lionfish data for the years before it was detected and any years it wasn't detected when surveys were done.
survey_years <- data.frame("YR" = sort(unique(bio_data_clean$YR)))
# survey_years

## need to add zeroes to the lionfish data for the SURVEY STATIONS within each year where lionfish were NOT detected...


## Do a right join to the survey_years work for adding zeroes to the lionfish_data to get the animation to show the blank years.
lionfish_data <- lionfish_data %>% 
  right_join(survey_years, join_by(YR))

```



```{r function to calculate CG}

survey_years

cg <- data.frame(latitude = double(),
                 longitude = double())

for(i in 1:length(unique(lionfish_data$YR))) {
  filter(lionfish_data, YR == survey_years[i,])
  cg$latitude[i] <- sum(lionfish_data$DECSLAT*lionfish_data$SELECT_BGS)
  cg$longitude[i] <- sum(lionfish_data$DECSLON*lionfish_data$SELECT_BGS)
}
  

```
