## Mapping the SEAMAP Trawl stations over time

```{r setup}


```



# Visualize Data - Sampling Locations

```{r}

# library(leaflet)
# 
# 
# # how can I filter out the excess data from bio_data so I only have one set of coordinates for each trawl station?
# ## - the small_starec_data only has 1 row for each STATIONID.
# 
# trawl_locations <- inner_join(x = small_starec_data, y = bio_data, by = join_by(STATIONID))
# # hmm this is still giving me ALL the rows....
# # need to select out the unnecessary columns from bio_data?
# 
# 
# trawl_locations_2 <- (small_starec_data$STATIONID == bio_data$STATIONID) == TRUE # this doesn't work...
# 
# 
# leaflet(bio_data)

```
